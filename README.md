# Algorithmic Dessign 2019/20: José Antonio Fernández Santisteban

This is the repository with the solutions to the exercises of Algorithmic Dessign on the course 2019/2020 made by José Antonio Fernández. The reference repositories with the templates for almost-all the coding exercises are the following:[insertion_sort.h](src/insertion_sort.h)

## Structure of the repository

The main purpose of this repository is the one of hold the solution to the proposed exercises. These exercises can be found into `AD_repo/exercises`, organized by the name of the pdf in which it was the text of the exercises. The **exercises folders** are the following:

* Homeworks 02 (Strassen algorithm): [`02_homework`](exercises/02_homework/02_homework.md).
* Homeworks 04 (Binary heaps): [`04_homework`](exercises/04_homework/04_homework.md).
* Homeworks 04 (Binary heaps, alternative implementation): [`04_homework_2`](exercises/04_homework_2/04_homework2.md).
* Homeworks 05 (Sorting): [`05_homework`](exercises/05_homework/05_homework.md).
* Homeworks 05 (Sorting, generalization of $\mathrm{SELECT}$): [`05_homework2`](exercises/05_homework2).
* Homeworks 08 (Dijkstra's algorithm): [`08_homework`](exercises/08_homework/08_homework.md).

The folders with the  implemented **code** are the following:

* Strassen algorithm: [`AD_strassen_template`](AD_strassen_template).
* Binary heaps: [`AD_bin_heaps`](AD_bin_heaps).
* Binary heaps, alternative implementation: [`AD_bin_heaps_modified`](AD_bin_heaps_modified)
* Sorting: [`AD_sorting`](AD_sorting).
* Sorting, generalization of $\mathrm{SELECT}$: [`AD_sorting_improved`](AD_sorting_improved).
* Dijkstra's algorithm array-based: [`AD_weighted_graphs_array`](AD_weighted_graphs_array).
* Dijkstra's algorithm heap-based: [`AD_weighted_graphs_heap` ](AD_weighted_graphs_heap).

There are links on the different exercises to the code folders, so in principle it should not be necessary to navigate within the folder structure to retrieve the code of each exercise.

## Code compilation

In order to run the code (if necessary), it is necessary to compile it previously. There are specific instructions in each code folder's `README.md` to compile.
